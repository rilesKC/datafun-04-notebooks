Module Chapters

    Explore Chapter 7 - Array-Oriented Programming with NumPy
    Explore Chapter 8 - Strings: A Deeper Look

Contrary to the names of the chapters, the most generally useful things here are:

    Jupyter - a browser-based environment for processing and presenting analytics. 
    We use Jupyter (and the integrated Python and Markup languages) to "tell a story with data"
    Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) are great for all steps in a data analytics project:
        Defining the question.
        Collecting the data.
        Exploring and cleaning the data.
        Processing and analyzing the data.
        Visualizing, reporting, and sharing your results.
    The pandas library is widely used. 
    The pandas library gives us a Series (for one dimensional data)
    It also provides the pandas DataFrame for two-dimensional data (like a spreadsheet). 
    It makes it easy to read from files, explore data, and provides a foundation for visualization (e.g., with matplotlib and seaborn).
    To get access to these tools, we'll go beyond the Python Standard Library and install additional, external libraries. 
    Before we can import them, we must first download and install them into our active Python environment (if using conda, this is typically the 'base' or default environment).
    It's possible to have many different Python virtual environments, each with a specific Python version and set of libraries installed. In this course we just use base - do a web search to learn more.
